# Use EJS to Template the Express Application

Instead of writing static HTML code and hardcoding dynamic values, it's a better practice to interpolate content in the template so the values will update automatically. In this project, EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is used as the view engine to embed information and template an Express application.

## ‚ú® Project Summary

To configure an Express application to use EJS:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run `npm i ejs` to install EJS.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify EJS as the view engine by writing `app.set("view engine", "ejs")`. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up a `views` directory to store EJS templates. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Define the absolute path for `views` directory and make it globally accessible:
```sh

const path = require('path')
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '/views'))

```
5Ô∏è‚É£ Render HTML content with an EJS file using `res.render()`. This will allow Express to look for EJS templates inside `views` directory automatically.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Interpolate values with `<%= %>` in the EJS file. To embed JavaScript without rendering the result as an output, surround the JavaScript code with `<% %>` instead.

7Ô∏è‚É£ To serve static files (CSS & JS files), set up a `public` directory and create an absolute path for it to enable the `public` directory to serve files globally:

```sh
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "/public")))

```
8Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `partials` folder inside of the `views` directory. Partials are duplicated markups. For example, `<head>` that contains Bootstrap link, JS script, JQuery script OR the same navbar that might be needed in multiple files. Include partials in separate EJS files and import them into HTML when necessary using EJS tags `<%- include() %>` helps to streamline our code.


## üíª Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the command below to install packages used in the project:
```sh

$ npm install

```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install nodemon globally so that it'll restart the application when changes are made to the project:
```sh

$ npm install -g nodemon

```


3Ô∏è‚É£ Run `nodemon app` in the terminal to start the server, and connect to `http//localhost:3000` in the web browser.
